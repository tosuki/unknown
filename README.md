# 🎮 Unknown

**Unknown** is a lightweight game prototype built with **Pygame**, created primarily to support and simplify game development during my classes.  

The main goal of this project is to make building games with Pygame **faster and more organized**, especially for educational or prototyping purposes.

> ⚠️ I don't plan to maintain this project long-term. I'll keep updating it as long as I'm taking game development classes.
